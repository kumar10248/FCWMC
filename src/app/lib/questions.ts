      "Connection setup delay",
      "Best-effort delivery",
      "Out-of-order delivery"
    ],
    "explanation": "Circuit switching requires establishing a dedicated path before communication can begin. This setup process involves signaling and resource reservation across the network, which introduces delay before actual data transmission starts. This is particularly noticeable in telephone systems where you hear ringing before connection.",

    "options": [
      "Handover",
      "DNS resolution",
      "Proxy forwarding"
    ],
    "explanation": "Handover is a mobility management function that maintains connectivity as users move between cell towers, but it doesn't reduce network traffic. DNS resolution and proxy forwarding can reduce traffic through caching and optimization, while handover focuses on seamless connectivity rather than traffic optimization.",

    "options": [
      "It better supports user mobility.",
      "It provides more bandwidth hence, better throughput.",
      "It reduces operating costs."

      "(A) uncertainty, (B) fair, (C) 1",
      "(A) uncertainty, (B) unfair, (C) 0"
    ],
    "explanation": "Information theory states that the amount of information obtained from a random experiment equals the amount of uncertainty about the result. For a coin toss, information is maximized when the coin is fair (equal probability of heads and tails), creating maximum uncertainty. A fair coin provides exactly 1 bit of information since there are 2 equally likely outcomes (logâ‚‚(2) = 1 bit).",

    "question": "Suppose that the maximum frequency component of a signal is W [Hz]. According to the sampling theorem, if the sample rate is above or equal to (A)_____, called the Nyquist rate, the original signal can be recovered perfectly. Representing a continuous value requires (B)______ number of bits because the resolution is (B)_______. If we increase the resolution of a quantizer, the distortion is (C)_______ but the information rate will be (D)_______.",

      "(A) W, (B) infinite, (C) decreased, (D) increased",
      "(A) 2W, (B) finite, (C) increased, (D) decreased",
      "(A) 2W, (B) infinite, (C) increased, (D) decreased",
      "(A) 2W, (B) infinite, (C) decreased, (D) increased"
    ],
    "explanation": "The Nyquist sampling theorem requires a sampling rate of at least 2W (twice the maximum frequency) to perfectly recover the original signal. Representing continuous values theoretically requires infinite bits for perfect precision. Increasing quantizer resolution decreases distortion (better approximation) but increases the information rate (more bits needed per sample).",

A(n) (A)_______ can propagate a long distance with the speed of light. By doing this, we can deliver information wirelessly. Mathematically, we can decompose a signal according to its constituent (B)______ components. The power spectrum of a signal indicates the power distribution of the information bearing signal according to (B)______. Here, the range of non-zero power distribution is called the signal (C)______ and it determines the speed of change in the signal. Remember that this is one resource we need to pay for transferring information. If we increase the (D)______ of the transmit signal, the intensity of the propagated radio wave increases, which implies longer propagation distance and better immunity for non-ideal effects. So, (D)______ is another resource we need to pay.",

      "(A) acoustic wave, (B) frequency, (C) bandwidth, (D) power",
      "(A) acoustic wave, (B) time, (C) power, (D) bandwidth"
    ],
    "explanation": "Antennas convert electrical current into radio waves and vice versa. Radio waves propagate at the speed of light enabling wireless communication. Signals are decomposed into frequency components, with the power spectrum showing power distribution across frequencies. The bandwidth (range of non-zero power) determines signal variation speed. Increasing transmit power increases radio wave intensity, enabling longer range and better immunity to interference.",

    "question": "The PSD of the thermal noise is (A)_____. The noise power contained within the bandwidth of W is (B)_____. Using the bandwidth of W is equivalent to use (C)_____ independent samples. Then, the Shannon capacity is given as (D)_____ when the received signal power is P.",
    "options": [
      "(A) Nâ‚€/2, (B) Nâ‚€W, (C) W, (D) W/2 logâ‚‚(1 + 2P/Nâ‚€W)",
      "(A) Nâ‚€/2, (B) Nâ‚€W, (C) 2W, (D) W/2 logâ‚‚(1 + 2P/Nâ‚€W)",

      "(A) Nâ‚€, (B) 2Nâ‚€W, (C) 2W, (D) W logâ‚‚(1 + P/Nâ‚€W)"
    ],
    "explanation": "Thermal noise has a flat power spectral density (PSD) of Nâ‚€/2 watts per Hz. Over bandwidth W, the total noise power is Nâ‚€W. By the Nyquist theorem, bandwidth W supports 2W independent samples per second. The Shannon capacity formula is C = W logâ‚‚(1 + P/Nâ‚€W) where P is signal power and Nâ‚€W is noise power.",

    "question": "What is the right order of processing sequence at the transmitter?",
    "options": [
      "(Channel Encoding) â€“ (Constellation Mapping) â€“ (Waveform Mapping) â€“ (Up Converting & Power Amp)",
      "(Channel Encoding) â€“ (Waveform Mapping) â€“ (Constellation Mapping) â€“ (Up Converting & Power Amp)",

      "(Constellation Mapping) â€“ (Channel Encoding) â€“ (Up Converting & Power Amp) â€“ (Waveform Mapping)"
    ],
    "explanation": "The correct transmitter processing sequence is: 1) Channel Encoding (adds error correction codes), 2) Constellation Mapping (maps bits to symbols), 3) Waveform Mapping (converts symbols to analog waveforms), and 4) Up Converting & Power Amplification (shifts to transmission frequency and amplifies). This sequence ensures proper signal preparation from digital data to RF transmission.",

  {
    "question": "Consider the case where a detection fails but the channel decoder recovers it. The noisy received symbols close to the (A)_______ are very probable to produce bit errors. But, the channel decoder may find that the erroneous bit sequence is not a possible candidate sequence and correct the errors by mapping to the closest (B)_______ sequence. Although such mapping can fail either, such probability vanishes as the information bit size k (C)_____.",
    "options": [
      "(A) original symbols, (B) erroneous, (C) increases",
      "(A) original symbols, (B) possible, (C) decreases",
      "(A) original symbols, (B) possible, (C) increases",
      "(A) boundaries, (B) erroneous, (C) decreases",
      "(A) boundaries, (B) possible, (C) increases"
    ],
    "explanation": "In digital communication systems, received symbols near decision boundaries between constellation points are most likely to cause detection errors. Channel decoders can correct these errors by recognizing that the erroneous bit sequence is not a valid codeword and mapping it to the closest possible (valid) codeword. As the information block size k increases, the probability of decoding failure decreases due to better error correction capability with longer codes.",

      "If we divide the area into many cells and use one base station per each cell, much more power is required.",
      "If users in different cells reuse the same frequency channels, the required bandwidth becomes much reduced.",
      "Supporting many users in a large area by only one transmitter is the power efficient way.",
      "Cellular structure is bandwidth-efficient way to support many users in a large area but is not power-efficient."
    ],
    "explanation": "In cellular systems, frequency reuse across different cells dramatically reduces the total bandwidth requirement since the same frequencies can be used simultaneously in non-adjacent cells. This makes cellular architecture highly bandwidth-efficient for supporting many users across large areas, which is the primary advantage of cellular design.",

    ],
    "explanation": "In adaptive communications, the base station selects one among predetermined MCS (Modulation and Coding Schemes) based on the CQI (Channel Quality Indicator) reported by the user. This adaptive selection process is called AMC (Adaptive Modulation and Coding), which optimizes transmission parameters based on current channel conditions.",

    "question": "In frequency division multiple access (FDMA), (A)_____ channels are allocated by dividing frequency. In time division multiple access (TDMA), (B)_____ channels are allocated by dividing time. In code division multiple access (CDMA), typically (C)_____ codes are allocated to users so that each user can use the whole time and bandwidth.",

      "(A) quasi-orthogonal (B) orthogonal (C) quasi-orthogonal",
      "(A) quasi-orthogonal (B) quasi-orthogonal (C) quasi-orthogonal"
    ],
    "explanation": "FDMA uses orthogonal frequency channels (non-overlapping frequencies), TDMA uses orthogonal time slots (non-overlapping time periods), and CDMA uses quasi-orthogonal spreading codes. In CDMA, perfect orthogonality is difficult to maintain due to multipath propagation and timing issues, so quasi-orthogonal codes are used, which have low but non-zero cross-correlation.",
    "correctAnswer": [1]

      "FDMA â‰¥ TDMA â‰¥ CDMA",
      "TDMA â‰¥ FDMA â‰¥ CDMA"
    ],
    "explanation": "In terms of achievable rate regions for two users, FDMA typically provides the largest rate region because it uses orthogonal frequency separation without interference. TDMA is next, using orthogonal time slots. CDMA has the smallest rate region due to multiple access interference from quasi-orthogonal codes, where users interfere with each other even when using different spreading codes.",

  {
    "question": "Which action is better to cope with the so called \"cocktail effect\"?",
    "options": [
      "Shutdown every transmission",
      "Scheduling of transmission (e.g., round-robin way of transmission, allowing only some group of transmitters to transmit, etc)"
    ],
    "explanation": "The cocktail effect refers to interference caused by multiple simultaneous transmissions in wireless networks. Scheduling transmission using methods like round-robin or allowing only specific groups to transmit at certain times reduces interference by coordinating access to the shared wireless medium, rather than shutting down all transmissions which would be counterproductive.",
    "correctAnswer": [1]
  },
  {
    "question": "In a single channel radio network, as the number of communicating pairs increases, it is impossible to support every pair. Which is the better solution for such overwhelming interference scenario?",
    "options": [
      "Shrink the communication distance (such as multi-hop relay)",
      "Make every node \"move\" randomly and wait for the source node to be close to its destination node."
    ],
    "explanation": "Shrinking communication distance through multi-hop relay reduces interference by decreasing transmission power and creating smaller interference zones. This allows more simultaneous communications in different parts of the network, effectively increasing spatial reuse and overall network capacity compared to random movement which is unpredictable and inefficient.",

    "question": "Why does the cellular system look like as of today?",
    "options": [
      "To handle large amount of interference",
      "To save the power consumption of mobile terminals"
    ],
    "explanation": "Modern cellular systems use hexagonal cell patterns and frequency reuse schemes primarily to manage and minimize interference between different cells. By carefully planning cell layouts and frequency assignments, cellular networks can handle the massive interference that would otherwise occur when millions of users communicate simultaneously in densely populated areas.",

    "question": "What are the drawbacks to have stationary access points in the wireless network?",
    "options": [
      "Increasing transmission power of mobile terminals.",
      "Frequent handover (switching to a new access point) as mobile terminals move around the service area."
    ],
    "explanation": "Stationary access points require frequent handovers as mobile devices move through the coverage area. Each time a device moves from one access point's coverage to another's, a handover process must occur to maintain connectivity. This creates signaling overhead, potential service interruptions, and complexity in mobility management.",

  {
    "question": "Increasing the base station density will increase the capacity of the cellular system?",
    "options": [
      "Yes, if the number of mobile terminals is fixed and their demand is fixed.",
      "Yes, even if the number of mobile terminals and their demand increase."
    ],
    "explanation": "Increasing base station density increases capacity only when the user population and their traffic demands remain constant. More base stations mean smaller cells, allowing for better spatial reuse of frequencies. However, if both the number of users and their demands increase proportionally with base station density, the capacity gain may be offset by the increased load.",

      "Long-distance transmission",
      "Frequent handover"
    ],
    "explanation": "5G networks are characterized by ultra-dense base station deployments for better coverage and capacity, and millimeter wave (mmWave) transmission for extremely high data rates. These features enable 5G's key capabilities: enhanced mobile broadband, ultra-reliable low-latency communications, and massive machine-type communications. Long-distance transmission and frequent handover are not unique 5G features.",

    "options": [
      "The target SIR is too high.",
      "One mobile is too close to the base station."
    ],
    "explanation": "In uplink power control, when the target Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) is set too high, it may become impossible for both users to achieve their required quality simultaneously due to interference limitations. In such cases, it's better to shut off one user to allow the other to meet the high SIR requirement, rather than having both users fail to achieve acceptable performance.",
    "correctAnswer": [0]
  },
  {
    "question": "In the distributed power control (DPC) algorithm, who measures the SIR (signal to interference), and reports it to whom?",
    "options": [
      "The base station measures it and report to the mobile terminal.",
      "The mobile terminal measures it and report to the base station."
    ],
    "explanation": "In distributed power control (DPC) algorithm, the base station measures the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) of the received signals from mobile terminals and reports this measurement back to the respective mobile terminal. The mobile terminal then uses this feedback to adjust its transmission power accordingly. This allows for distributed control where each mobile terminal can independently manage its power based on the SIR feedback from the base station.",

    "options": [
      "Maximize the minimum throughput of users",
      "Proportional fairness"
    ],
    "explanation": "Proportional fairness is a widely used objective in packet scheduling that balances fairness and throughput maximization. It ensures that users receive bandwidth proportional to their channel conditions while maintaining some level of fairness. This approach prevents users with poor channel conditions from being completely starved while still allowing the system to achieve good overall throughput.",

    "options": [
      "Increasing \"average\" data rate of each user.",
      "Save the power consumption of base stations."
    ],
    "explanation": "Packet scheduling's primary benefit is increasing the average data rate for each user by intelligently allocating resources based on channel conditions, traffic demands, and fairness criteria. By scheduling transmissions when channel conditions are favorable and managing resources efficiently, packet scheduling significantly improves user experience and network efficiency compared to simple round-robin approaches.",

      "6"
    ],
    "explanation": "In a perfectly uncorrelated multipath channel with 2 Tx antennas and 2 Rx antennas, the maximum number of exploitable paths is 4. This is because each transmit antenna can have independent multipath channels to each receive antenna, creating 2Ã—2 = 4 independent spatial paths that can be exploited for spatial multiplexing or diversity.",

    "explanation": "For a 2Ã—2 MIMO system with 2 bps/Hz per symbol modulation, the maximum spectral efficiency is 4 bps/Hz. This is calculated as: 2 spatial streams Ã— 2 bps/Hz per symbol = 4 bps/Hz total.

      "Diversity gain can be made by antenna selection.",
      "Alamouti coding is a type of antenna selection."
    ],
    "explanation": "The two erroneous statements are: 1) 'Multi-user MIMO can only be formed when a base station and a user both have multiple antennas at their sides' - Multi-user MIMO only requires multiple antennas at the base station, not necessarily at each user. 2) 'Alamouti coding is a type of antenna selection' - Alamouti coding is a space-time block coding technique, not antenna selection. It uses space-time coding across multiple antennas simultaneously.",

    ],
    "explanation": "Based on the water-filling algorithm diagrams shown, option D does not achieve maximum sum rate. The water-filling algorithm allocates power optimally across subcarriers based on channel conditions. Option D shows a suboptimal power allocation that doesn't follow the water-filling principle, resulting in lower sum rate compared to the optimal allocation.",

    "explanation": "For good transmission performance from Tx to Rx through a duplexer system, S21 and S12 should have high values. S21 represents the forward transmission coefficient (Tx to Rx path), and S12 represents the reverse transmission coefficient. High values for these parameters indicate good signal transmission through the duplexer with minimal loss.",

    ],
    "explanation": "If the signal power is boosted by 100 times, this represents a 20 dB increase (10 Ã— log10(100) = 20 dB). Adding this to the original antenna gain: 10 dBi + 20 dB = 30 dBi. Therefore, the ideal gain of the antenna array would be 30 dBi.",
